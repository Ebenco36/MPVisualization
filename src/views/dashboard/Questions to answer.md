Domain: Bridging the Gap in Membrane Protein Research
Through Visualization and Metadata Enrichment of
Membrane Protein Structures


Task abstractions:
Task outside visualization

    1. Data integration
        1. MPstruc integration with PDB for extract meta information on each protein entry
        2. OPM provides structural information such as Domain, Phylum, Spieces and others
        3. UniProt provides information about the molecular function, cellular and biological information.

Provide visuals for relevant features from the metedata such as:

    1. Spatial distribution view:
        a. Trend of Membrane proteins resolved overtime by countries to illustrate the contributions and efforts from each country. This concentration suggests a regional bias that might influence the diversity and scope of the proteins studied. (Choropleth Map and Bar Chart)

    2. Summary statistics view:
        a. Overall growth of membrane protein resolved over time. (Bar chart) 
        a. Resolution trend: Dominant method for membrane protein resolution (Line Chart)
        

    3. Identify Outlier with respect to resolution (Box Plot)

    4. Data validation with databases
        a. Show contributions from all databases (Line Chart)


    5. Protein classification into their respective domains (New -> leverage on Chisom work for tree representation).
        a. This could also be part of our training and test (Encourage users to use tree and discuss their experience)
